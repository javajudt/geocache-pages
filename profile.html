    <p>
        Hello there! I'm glad you found your way over to my profile. I've been geocaching since early 2010, when I was
        14 years old. Wow, time sure does fly when you're having fun! I enjoy traveling to new places by road or air,
        and always
        have to find a cache (or five) along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm from Norfolk, Nebraska, born and raised. Norfolk (properly pronounced "Nor-fork") is home to Nebraska's
        first <a title="Visit Norfolk Area Nebraska GeoTour"
            href="https://www.geocaching.com/play/geotours/norfolk-nebraska">GeoTour</a>, as well as some of the most <a

        caches in the area. Stop by for a visit; you won't be disappointed!
    </p>
    <p>
        I spent four years in Vermillion, South Dakota, attending the University of South Dakota to earn my Bachelor of
        Science degree in computer science. I am now settled into a career of software development and engineering, and
        I'm loving (almost) every minute of it. If you look at my stats below, you'll see a pretty steady decline in
        yearly cache find count during college and even in my first year out of college. I'd be lying if I said that
        surprised me, but I'm glad to have more time to go geocaching now!
    </p>
    <p>
        When I'm not at work or out on the trail geocaching, I enjoy making music with my violin, which I'll break out
        at an open mic night every now and then. I also enjoy riding bicycles long distances. I'll find the caches along
        the way if there are any to be found, but I've pretty much found everything along the trails in my area!
        Finally, when at home, a lot of the time I'll be working on personal app or website projects. I even have some
        ideas for some geocaching-related projects; I just need to find the time (and API access) to work on them!
    </p>

    <h1 style="text-align:left;">Caches</h1>

    <p>The descriptions for all of my active caches are available to be viewed, copied, and modified by anybody. Want to
        replicate the way I formatted one of my cache listings? Go for it! Maybe you saw a typo, or something that is no
        longer relevant is still listed in the description. Feel free to make your edits and submit them for approval!

        I have another geocaching-related repository for custom container labels, image assets, and other documents.
        Everything in there is free for you to use with your own caches and listings. Check it out!
