<!-- Cache info -->
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">Welcome to Sherwood Forest Park in Woodland Park! The
    park is open until 10:30 pm. RV pads with electricity are available, as well as picnic shelters, paved trails, and a
    playground for
    the kiddos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">This cache is located in a relatively new section of
    the park. A paved trail connects the two sections across a wetland area. There is also a separate parking area here
    if you would rather drive.</p>
