<!-- Short description -->
<p style="text-align: center; color: crimson;">The coordinates for this Earthcache will take you to Old Main, an iconic building on the campus of the University of South Dakota. I've included several additional waypoints for buildings on campus that are built either mostly or partially with Sioux Quarzite. It is not necessary to visit every location; just choose one (or more, if desired) and answer the questions at the end of the description.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.25em;font-weight:bold">Strata and Stratification, a Building Block of Geology</p>
<p style="text-align:center; color: darkred;">A stratum is an individual layer of rock, and stratification is the actual layering that is going on in the rock. It takes many (well, at least two) strata to have stratification. Strata are separated by what are known as stratification planes, which are produced by changes in mineral properties like grain size, texture, and color. In other words, the different layers can be distinguished by visible changes in the material that make them up. A single layer can measure anywhere from a few millimeters to several meters thick, and can cover just a few square meters to many square meters laterally. When looking at the exposed side of a hill or cliff, it's easy to forget that the layers you see may extend through that entire chunk of land!</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color: crimson;">Layers of rock typically form parallel to each other. Minerals get deposited evenly over an existing layer, conforming to the previous layer's irregularities. Interestingly, there are times when deposits are not stratified. Minerals transported via ice or landslide are not stratified. Also, existing strata can be destroyed by plants, animals, or other external forces.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color: darkred;">One example of non-parallel stratification is cross-bedding. Cross-bedding of rock occurs when inclined layers exist within the normal layering of a section of rock. It is formed in a fluid environment, like an environment with wind or water. Particles collect on the upstream side of a dune until they reach the angle of repose. Then, because the crest of this material has grown too large, it falls to the downstream side. Several repetitions of this process eventually produce the cross-bedding.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: crimson;">Quarzite is a metamorphic rock, with colors ranging from pink to red. It is not quite 2 billion years old, and it is some of the hardest rock around. Because it is so resistant to erosion, it works great for constructing strong, long-lasting buildings.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: darkred;">An outcropping is an area of, in this case, quartzite that has been exposed due to erosion of glacial drift. The quartzite outcropping located in this geographical area is called <em>Sioux Quarzite</em>. Like many cities, rivers, and other things in the area, it is named after the Sioux (Dakota) Native American tribes. This particular outcropping, pictured above, spans 180 miles east to west, and the width of the band north to south is about 40 miles. Unexposed quartzite, known as a subcrop, also extends west of the Missouri River.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: crimson;">A quarry in Sioux Falls has been operational since the late 19th century. It is estimated that the quarry contains another 10 years worth of material. Quartzite was transported to nearby destinations, such as Vermillion, by rail. Sioux Quartzite is used on the campus of the University of South Dakota as a building material for many different buildings; including Old Main, Belbas Center, East Hall, and the Muenster University Center (MUC). The MUC is a prime example of how Sioux Quartzite is still used in construction today.</p>
