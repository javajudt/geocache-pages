<!-- Cache info -->
<h2 style="text-align:center;">Nebraska Spirit Quest</h2>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">"Spirit Quest" caches are popular in a number of
    states. Simply put, a Spirit Quest cache is a cache that is hidden in a cemetery. Some states have a group of SQ
    cache hiders, and for others it's more informal. There's only a handful of caches in Nebraska named with
    "NESQ", "SQ", or "Nebraska Spirit Quest". I'd like to see this naming convention catch on so that it's easier to
    identify cemetery caches.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">St. Patrick's Cemetery is located on the northeast edge of Battle Creek, off of McAllister Street.
I couldn't find a lot of info about this Catholic cemetery, but the earliest death dates date back to the 1870s. It is still in use today and well-maintained.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">You're looking for a small container. It is located
    inside the cemetery, but away from the graves. Please respect mourners or services when present. Enjoy!</p>
