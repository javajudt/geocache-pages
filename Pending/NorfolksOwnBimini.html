<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">Welcome to Sherwood Forest Park in Woodland Park! The
    park is open until 10:30 pm. RV pads with electricity are available, as well as picnic shelters, paved trails, and a
    playground for
    the kiddos.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">Bimini is a small Bahamian island that lies about 50
    miles east of Miami, Florida.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">This container was slated to be a replacement container
    for an existing cache on Bimini, but that day's ferry to Bimini was canceled. How convenient that we have Woodland
    Park, like Norfolk's own little Bimini, to place it in instead!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">This cache is close to the playground - stealth
    required!</p>
