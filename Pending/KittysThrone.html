<!-- Cache info -->
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">I am shamelessly borrowing the idea for this cache from
    an online post I saw a while back for a similar cache in the Sioux Falls area.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">The cache itself should be easy to find, but there's an
    extra twist to get to the log. All tools you need are provided with the cache. You <strong>must</strong> sign your
    name to the <strong>official log</strong> in order to log this cache
    online. Please no swag or trackables in this cache.</p>

    you through the window! Enjoy! ðŸ˜º</p>
