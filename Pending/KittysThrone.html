<!-- Cache info -->
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">I am shamelessly borrowing the idea for this cache from
    an online post I saw a while back for a similar cache in the Sioux Falls area.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">This cache is located in the front yard of a private
    residence. The house is the second house south of Park Avenue. Permission has been granted for placement. Please
    don't park in the driveway, and please no caching between 10pm-7am.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">The cache itself should be easy to find, but there's an
    extra twist to get to the log. All tools you need are provided with the cache. You <strong>must</strong> sign your
    name to the <strong>official log</strong> in order to log this cache
    online. Please no swag or trackables in this cache.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">If you're lucky, you may see a cat or two peering at
    you through the window! Enjoy! ðŸ˜º</p>
