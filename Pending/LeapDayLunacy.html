<!-- Cache info -->
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">Happy Leap Day! I won this cache container at an event
    several years ago, and have been holding on to it for the right moment. Well, now is the right moment!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">The cache will be easy to find; however, the log won't
    be as easy. You <strong>must</strong> sign your name to the <strong>official log</strong> in order to log this cache
    online. Please no swag or trackables in this cache.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">The cache is placed in a public right-of-way section,
    and is easily accessible from the end of Norfolk Avenue. There is room to pull off the road. Do not park on Highway
    275 to access this cache.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">Have fun!</p>
