<!-- Cache info -->
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">This cache is placed in the smaller of Woodland Park's
    parks. For a while the park almost seemed abandoned, but it appears to be maintained today. This park includes a
    playground and a basketless disc golf course. (At least that's my best guess for the scattered posts in the ground
    with numbers on them!) The parking area for the park is only accessible from Meadow Lane.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">Please do not try to access this cache from the north.
    There is no public access from Forest Drive. Park at the parking coordinates off of Meadow Lane.</p>
