<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">As the ever-innovative <em>Homo sapiens</em> sits on
    the throne from time to time, so too must his best friend, <em>Canis familiaris</em>. And as innovative as man is,
    he is still responsible for cleaning up after his friend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">This cache brings you to the newer Cowboy Trail
    trailhead off of 1st Street. There is a parking area where you can drive right up to the cache, or you may prefer to
    walk or bike from Ta-Ha-Zouka Park on this paved section of trail. Shouldn't be a difficult find for most. Enjoy! üê∂
