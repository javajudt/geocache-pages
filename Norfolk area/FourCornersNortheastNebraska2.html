<p style="text-align:center;font-family:impact;font-size:x-large;color:#003300"><u>THE CACHE</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:large;color:#00CC00">This is attempt number two of this cache. The first cache (<a target="_blank" href="http://coord.info/gc2ya8a">GC2YA8A</a>) was an ammo can and went missing somehow. Maybe a micro will do better.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:large;color:#00CC00">This cache is located where four counties meet in one place. Technically, the cache is in either Pierce or Wayne county (I think Wayne), but it's about 10 feet (if even) from where the counties meet. You're looking for a 30 Cal. Ammo Can.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:impact;font-size:x-large;color:#000066"><u>THE COUNTIES</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:large;color:#0000FF">Grandview Drive is a north-south road (that is closed), and is the border for Madison and Stanton counties. Madison county is to the west and Stanton county is to the east. If Grandview Drive continued north past the &quot;<strong>&#8592;&#8594;</strong>&quot; sign, it would be 558th Avenue. That is Pierce and Wayne counties' border. Pierce county is west and Wayne is east.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:large;color:#000080">Kaneb Road and 846th Road are the same road and run east-west. West of Grandview Dr./558th Ave., it is the border for Madison and Pierce counties. Madison is south and Pierce is north. East of Grandview/558th, Kaneb Rd./846th Rd. is the border for Wayne and Stanton counties. Wayne county is north and Stanton is south.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:large;color:#0066CC">I thought the center of each road would be the county lines, but my mapping program says the lines are on the south edge of Kaneb and on the west edge of Grandview. I suppose that might be right...maybe.....</p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:impact;font-size:x-large;color:#800000"><u>HOW TO GET THERE/THE ROADS</u></p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:large;color:#FF3300">Don't come from directly 1 mile south...that's Grandview Drive. As mentioned earlier, that road is closed. There is no road from the north, so you can't come directly from the north. You'll have to zig-zag however you want so that when you're a mile out you're coming from the east and/or west. I came from west.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:comic sans ms;font-size:large;color:#CC0000">The roads to get there are paved, but eventually turn to gravel. The roads were very well maintained for me. The first time going out (by bike) I only had 3 cars pass me on Kaneb Rd. The second time (to place this cache), I only had one go by. It's obviously not a very busy road, but be sure to park off to the side for <em>just</em> in case.</p>
