<!-- Cache info -->
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: medium; color: #0468e1;">This cache will take you to a nice little garden on the campus of USD. (Pro tip: if you're going to play the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.geocaching.com/geocache/GC6PRZ6_the-university-of-south-dakota-campus-tour">Campus Tour Wherigo (GC6PRZ6)</a>, start with that before coming here!)</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: medium; color: #023a7e;">Nothing special about this cache, but I can tell you about the garden (the following is quoted from the aforementioned Wherigo cartridge):</p>

<p style="text-align: center; color: #5fb9fc;">Established in 1987 by Carroll G. Colwell, Wayne W. Gutzman, William O. Farber, and Marjorie H. Beaty, this Shakespeare Garden is one of many across the country. These gardens feature plants that are mentioned in Shakespeare's works.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #5fb9fc;">The garden at USD is located across from the Pardee Estee Laboratory building. Turn around for a second and take a look at the beautiful tile mural of chemistry above the entrance!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #5fb9fc;">This garden is special to the campus because it is the only one that a person can actually walk into and enjoy. In the center is a fountain presented by the Class of 1924. I haven't seen it in action, but I hope one day they get it turned on for all to enjoy. A bust of William Shakespeare hard at work is located at the back of the garden.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; color: #5fb9fc;">Eventually, the garden was pretty well forgotten and its upkeep was halted. During the summer of 2014, however, efforts were made by the facilities management team and the English department to revitalize the area. I don't know about you, but I'm glad the garden is back in business!</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: medium; color: #0468e1;">Stealth is required, especially between classes during the school year! Do not disturb any plants while on your caching adventure. You're looking for a DNA tube.</p>
