<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">Howdy, partner! Fall CITO Week for 2018 is September 15 through September 23. It's a great excuse to get out and help clean up your neighborhood.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">For this event, we'll meet at the Cowboy Trail parking lot on Broken Bridge Road at 8:30 am. We may as well call it a <span style="color:#0468e1">Cowboy In, Trash Out</span> event! We'll plan to clean up the area until 10:00ish am, but it could go shorter or longer depending on how much stuff there is to pick up.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">We can start out by cleaning up the parking lot. Then we'll go for a walk on the Cowboy Trail and pick up garbage along the way. Depending on how many people attend, we could potentially split up and have one group go west and one go east. Otherwise let's have everyone head west towards Broken Bridge. This seems to be a popular hangout spot, so there could be quite a bit to pick up in this area.</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">The terrain is pretty flat, but it is all gravel. It's just over a quarter mile walk to the bridge. Only do what you are comfortable doing. If you just want to stick to the parking lot, that is perfectly fine. If you want to go five miles, then you'll probably be on your own, but good for you!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #0468e1;">Trash bags will be provided. You'll have to bring anything else you might need like gloves, pick-em-up tools, or bug spray. Remember to dress for the weather!</p>
<p style="text-align: center; font-size: large; color: #023a7e;">Are you ready to make a difference on Saturday the 22nd? Me too! See you there!</p>
