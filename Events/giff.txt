<p style="color:green;">Come join us for the first ever GIFF in Vermillion--your chance to see the 16 finalist films from the 2015 Geocaching International Film Festival. The viewing will be held at the W.H. Over Museum on the campus of the University of South Dakota.  There is plenty of parking nearby (DakotaDome lot) and admission is free. In the past you could only see these films if you went to the event held every year in Seattle at the Block Party and this year, at the very last ever Block Party, the Film Festival was unfortunately rained out.</p>

<p style="color:darkred;">So to make it up to all of us, the weekend of November 5-8 only, geocachers all over the world will host geocaching events at which the films from the 2015 Geocaching International Film Festival will be shown--the first public viewing of these films ever.<br/>
<b><span style="color:darkred;">There will even be a special Souvenir issued for those that attend!!!</span></b></p>

<p style="color:darkblue;"><b>All films have been described as being family friendly.</b></p>
